# Introduction 

The unfortunate aspect about American politics is that political polarization has become a defining norm. It becomes more apparent from the approval rating when a polarizing candidate steps in to office, like in the case of Donald J. Trump when he won the election as president of the United States. According to the 2017 surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, 88% of Republicans approved of Trump's first year in office in contrast to the dismal 8% from the Democrats [1]. 

But with the Russian investigation, high staff turnover rates, and Trump's failure to fulfill his campaign promises, it has left many Americans, including Republicans, doubtful that their interests are being served. Or at least, that is what several media outlets claim. 

For this reason, we decided to conduct an experiment to see if the political divide and rise of pessimism were as accurate as the media portrayed. We selected four topics, each of which has considerable relevance to a person living in the United States and is neutral across political lines. By inserting Trump into these topics, we hope to address the media portrayal in two-fold:

* Political polarization: Are we (as America) divided enough in political partisanship to have different level of optimism regardless of Trump?
* Rise of pessimism due to Trump: Is the rise of pessimism strong enough that anything Donald Trump says or does will trigger a level of anger regardless of the person's political affiliation?



# Research Question


Why is this interesting to someone who is predisposed to be interested?  

What other people know about this? 

What (if any) observational work has to say about this question?

# Hypothesis 

Given the strong emotional response that Trump elicits from people across the political spectrum, we hypothesize that even a subtle mention of his name can momentarily affect the immediate level of optimism some people have on important life priorities.

The purpose of our experiment is to measure the extent to which polarizing political figures--Donald Trump in particular--cause cognitive
