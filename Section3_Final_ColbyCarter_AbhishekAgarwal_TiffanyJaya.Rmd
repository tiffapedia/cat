# Introduction 

The unfortunate aspect about American politics is that political polarization has become a defining norm. It becomes more apparent from the approval rating when a polarizing candidate steps in to office, like in the case of Donald J. Trump when he won the election as president of the United States. According to the 2017 surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, 88% of Republicans approved of Trump's first year in office in contrast to the dismal 8% from the Democrats [1]. 

But with the Russian investigation, high staff turnover rates, and Trump's failure to fulfill his campaign promises, it has left many Americans, including  Republicans, doubtful that their interests are being served. Or at least, that is what several media outlets claim. 

For this reason, we have decided to conduct an experiment


Polarization -> Are we divided enough to have a different level of optimism with and without Trump. 
Is the rise of pessimism strong enough that anything he says or do will trigger a level of anger regardless of  political lines


Does even a subtle reminder of a particularly polarizing political figure (here, Donald Trump) cause cognitive dissonance, i.e. inconsistent beliefs largely driven by an emotional response?

Why? To understand whether deep political division and unrest portrayed by media result in significant gaps in optimism and economic outlook

# Research Question


Why is this interesting to someone who is predisposed to be interested?  

What other people know about this? 

What (if any) observational work has to say about this question?

# Hypothesis 

Given the strong emotional response that Trump elicits from people across the political spectrum, we hypothesize that even a subtle mention of his name can momentarily affect the immediate level of optimism some people have on important life priorities.

The purpose of our experiment is to measure the extent to which polarizing political figures--Donald Trump in particular--cause cognitive
