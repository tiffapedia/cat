Introduction
Satisfaction surveys have been used in many countries ""to assess community needs, to guide long-range planning, to guide short-term planning, to assess communication with citizens, to evaluate community services, and to determine policy support."" As part of our graduate study in social sciences, we are conducting satisfaction survey on residences of the United States to better understand if the needs of the communities have been met. 
Procedures
After consenting to the survey, you will be asked four questions ranging from employment opportunities to retirement savings. Please answer using the slider to represent your assessment of the topic. It should not take you longer than 10 minutes.  
Risks
Your participation in this survey is entirely voluntary. There is a risk that you may feel uncomfortable sharing your personal opinion on some topics, however your answers will not be shared with anyone.
Benefits
There will be no direct benefit to you, but your participation is likely to help us gauge the satisfaction of residences living in the United States.
Confidentiality
We will not be sharing information about you to anyone outside of the research team. The information that we collect from this survey will be kept private. Any information about you will have a number on it instead of your name. 
Compensation
You will be compensated based upon the pricing set in Amazon Mechanical Turk, provided a reasonable level of time and effort is taken to read and answer each brief prompt. A code will be messaged to you at the completion of the survey.

Now approaching a decade since the worst of the 2008 financial crisis, a steady recovery in the United States has brought a return of modest, sustained economic growth averaging roughly two percent annually, along with rising wage growth of over three percent. While rapid technological advancement has brought new efficiency and growth opportunities to many segments of the economy, many geographic areas and industries also face difficulties competing in global markets and continuing to provide economic opportunities. Overall, however, the unemployment rate has reached a decade-low of close to four percent in 2018, a level lower than pre-crisis unemployment and considered by some economists to be full employment.

When evaluating the state of American secondary education--high-school level and above--the country has had mixed results in improving outcomes for its students, particularly over the last two decades. At the high school level, the national average graduation rate has risen to its highest point ever as of 2016 at 84%, up five percentage points from 2011. Meanwhile, standardized test scores have remained flat while continuing to fall relative to students in Asian countries, especially in STEM studies (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). With more high school graduates, college attendance has continued to grow at a high rate, with over 20 million active undergraduate students in 2017, up from 15 million students in 2000. This growth in attendance has contributed to a similarly large increase in the price of college education, up over 50% on average since 2000 (after inflation), and an increase in student debt of $1 trillion in the last decade. College graduation rates still lag far behind many other developed nations with only 47% of adults aged 25-34 holding at least an associate's degree.

Among competing priorities of paying for education, a home, medical treatment, and many other necessities of life--particularly when raising a family--saving for retirement often falls toward the bottom of the list. Although many employers have moved to attract talented employees by contributing to retirement funds such as 401(k) accounts, historical market volatility can still add to this anxiety: as we saw in 2000-2001 as well as 2008-2009, stock market crashes and ensuing economic decline can very quickly lead to substantial drops in retirement savings for many Americans. On the other hand, we have seen rapid expansions as well, with total stock indexes growing over 20% in 2017 alone. This volatility in equities has been coupled with historically-low interest rates over the last decade, leading to low returns for fixed income earners.

With recent advancements in computational technology and access to electronics and internet connectivity, there are new cybersecurity threats to many nations and their peoples around the world. In the United States over the last several years alone, there have been numerous attempts, some successful, by foreign actors to steal private and government data and disrupt societal norms. For example, recently credit reporting company Equifax experienced a data breach in which driverâ€™s license numbers were stolen from nearly 150 million customers. The have also been several other breaches at major multinational corporations such as Target, Sony and Costco. Warnings of data theft by way of the Huawei phone technology have been given by the U.S., linking the Chinese company to its government, long accused of stealing government data. The energy sector and its electric grid has also been a noted target in recent years. As a result, private and public sector cybersecurity improvements have been prioritized by U.S. national security agencies.
