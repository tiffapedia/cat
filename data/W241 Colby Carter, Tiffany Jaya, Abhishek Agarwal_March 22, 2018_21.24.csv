Introduction
Satisfaction surveys have been used in many countries ""to assess community needs, to guide long-range planning, to guide short-term planning, to assess communication with citizens, to evaluate community services, and to determine policy support."" As part of our graduate study in social sciences, we are conducting satisfaction survey on residences of the United States to better understand if the needs of the communities have been met. 
Procedures
After consenting to the experiment, you will be asked four questions ranging from employment opportunities to retirement savings. Please answer using the slider how satisfied you are based on the questions asked. It should not take you longer than 10 minutes.  
Risks
Your participation in this survey is entirely voluntary. There is a risk that you may feel uncomfortable sharing your personal opinion on some topics. We do not wish for this to happen. For this reason, you do not have to answer any question that may make you feel this way.
Benefits
There will be no direct benefit to you, but your participation is likely to help us gauge the satisfaction of residences living in the United States.
Confidentiality
We will not be sharing information about you to anyone outside of the research team. The information that we collect from this survey will be kept private. Any information about you will have a number on it instead of your name. 
Compensation
You will be compensated based on the pricing by Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Now approaching a decade since the worst of the 2008 financial criss, a steady recovery in the United States has brought a return to modest, sustained economic growth averaging roughly two percent annually, along with rising wage growth of over three percent. While rapid technological advancement has brought new efficiency and growth opportunities to many segments of the economy, many geographic areas and industries also face difficulties competing in global markets and continuing to provide economic opportunities. Overall, however, the unemployment rate has reached a decade-low close to four percent in 2018, a level approaching that considered by some economists to be ""full employment.""

When evaluating the state of American secondary education--high-school level and above--the country has had mixed results in improving outcomes for its students with notable trends particularly over the last two decades. At the high school level, the national average graduation rate has risen to its highest point as of 2016 at 84%, up five percentage points from 2011. Meanwhile, however, standardized test scores have remained flat while continuing to fall below those of students in Asian countries. With more high school graduates, college attendance has continued to grow at a high rate, with over 20 million active undergraduate students in 2017, up from 15 million students in 2000. This growth in attendance has contributed to a similarly large increase in the price of college education, up over 50% on average since 2000 (after inflation), and in increase in student debt of $1 trillion in the last decade. Job opportunities with an undergraduate degree, however, currently correspond to an estimated unemployment rate of under three percent.

Among competing priorities of paying for education, a home, medical treatment, and many other necessities of life--particularly when raising a family--saving for retirement often falls toward the bottom of the list. Although many employers have moved to attract talented employees by contributing to retirement funds, such as 401(k) accounts, historical market volatility can add to this anxiety: as we saw in 2000-2001 as well as 2008-2009, economic recession can very quickly lead to substantial declines in market values and as a result, retirement savings. On the other hand, we have seen rapid expansions as well, with total stock indexes growing over 20% in 2017 alone. This volatility in equities has been coupled with historically-low interest rates over the last decade, leading to low returns for fixed income earners.

With the rise of computational and government technology and its role in geopolitics, there are new cybersecurity threats to economic powers and their people around the world. In the United States over the last several years alone, there have been numerous attempts, some successful, by foreign actors to steal private and government data and disrupt societal norms. For example, recently credit reporting company Equifax experience a data breach in which driver’s license numbers were stolen from nearly 150 million customers. Warnings of data theft by way of the Huawei phone technology have been made by the U.S., linking the Chinese company to its government long accused of stealing government data. In our most recent national election, Russian actors have been accused of attempting to disrupt democratic processes by stealing private emails and influencing social media. The energy sector and its electric grid has also been a noted target. As a result, cybersecurity improvements have been prioritized by national security agencies.
